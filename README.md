I'm not sure where the background image came from - it's just a placeholder which I'll replace once I get a chance
this is a free tutorial (non-profit)
but if anyone has an issue with any of these placeholder images, let me know and I'll remove/replace them

The main character and controller scripts is from the Unity 2D platformer tutorial - since Gravity Guy is a free tutorial to help people get to know Unity in a step-by-step gentle fashion, I'm assuming Unity are happy for me to reuse their openly available 2D tutorial assets
but if anyone has an issue with any of these placeholder images, let me know and I'll remove/replace them

have fun!
